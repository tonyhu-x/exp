**Q6: What specific background do you have that might support your success in this/these course(s)? For e.g.: software knowledge, data projects, university courses, guided study, workshops, incubators, accelerators, etc. If applying for CSC491, please include information about software development, data analysis or other relevant experience.**

As a CS major, I have the ability to work in a number of domains, including web development, firmware engineering, scripting, etc. I gained these skills not only through the university courses, but also: 1) through an internship I completed at AMD as a firmware engineer, 2) through working on my current personal project, a NPM package "react-experiment-builder", and 3) through various other research and class projects I was a part of. I mention my technical skills in detail in my response to Q12. I am also well trained to conduct independent research, from the conception of ideas to their execution and presentation, thanks to a guided project I completed, as well as participation in numerous professor-led research teams.

**Q7: If you have been involved in entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial projects or ventures, what were your responsibilities?**

I have limited experience in entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial settings. However, acknowledging my lack of experience is a big reason why I am excited to take these courses.

**Q8: What extracurricular or co-curricular organizations are you involved in? Which of them contribute to supporting your success in this course? If so, how?**

In my third year, I was a teaching assistant for MAT133: Calculus and Linear Algebra for Commerce. Being a TA made me a better teacher and communicator. It also taught me to deal with difficult situations with calmness, patience and to appreciate everyone's strengths while understanding their shortcomings.

In the same year, I was the Academic Coordinator for the Society of Linguistics Undergraduate Students, a.k.a. the linguistics student union. I planned, organized, and advertised academic events, collaborating effectively with other executive members to improve union presence.

Finally, I have been a member of the Iron Dragons Paddling Club at the Faculty of Engineering for two years. My team (of mostly engineers) has a strong sense of community.

My experience as TA and Academic Coordinator will directly contribute to my success in the course, as they have helped me develop soft skills essential in a team setting. Being on a sports team, on the other hand, helped me meet many determined and intelligent people, expanding my network circle. This I also believe to be highly valuable in the context of creating a successful startup.

**Q9: What is the most successful project that you have been involved in? How do you know it was successful? Why was it successful?**

My most successful project so far has been a linguistics research project that I designed and ran with the help of a professor from UTM. Within the span of eight months, I did a thorough literature review, designed a novel methodology, and completed pilot testing and data analysis. With the firm foundation laid out by the eight months of work, we are set to collect further data and more comprehensively test our hypotheses. While this project is not “successful” in the sense that it has borne its fruit and led to the publication of its results, I am proud of the progress I have made, give that it was my first time being the principal investigator behind a project. In addition, not only was the project a linguistic adventure, I also learned a lot about front-end web development, as I used my computer science background to my advantage to program a website for data collection. I attribute a lot of the project’s success to the fact that I was researching something I am truly passionate about. Further, I had a strong desire to acquire new knowledge, and this project was the perfect opportunity to do so.

**Q10: Describe your most significant project failures and the lessons you learned from them. How have your practices changed in response to these failures?**

My biggest project failure was a side project called Translify. My friend and I wanted to make an app which combined text translation and summary capabilities in an easy-to-use interface. The app touched on both of our respective interests, NLP and app frontend development. Unfortunately, the project stagnated and stopped as school started ramping up again.

Like in my successful project, I had both passion and a desire to learn. However, I realize now that those two things alone were not sufficient conditions for success. What I lacked back then was a correct assessment of the difficulty of the project, the amount of learning I needed to do before even a prototype was possible. That, along with an unclear project plan and timeline, was what made us eventually “slack off” when faced with other commitments.

Since then, I have learned to "not stretch myself too thin" and have a more realistic expectation of the amount of work I can get done in a given period of time. I have learned to reject some opportunities in order to prioritize others. Finally, I now proactively scope and plan every time I take on a new task.

**Q11: What are your major weaknesses, and how have they or might they impact a project team? How do you plan to mitigate or compensate for those weaknesses?**

My greatest weakness is that I pay too much attention to detail. While this trait allows me to excel at some tasks, sometimes the time it takes for me to think about every small decision and make sure I do things in the best way possible becomes a hinderance for making actual progress. Because of my high expectations in these respects, I find it less enjoyable to work with people who cannot keep up with them.

Since I became aware of this weakness, I have been mindful to tell myself to complete a task first and not be distracted to polish it until the bulk of the work is done. I have also realized that everyone is good at different tasks, so rather than pick at others for what they did imperfectly, I should instead learn to appreciate what they did well. Moreover, while I consider myself to be good at computer science in general and have experience in a few technical domains, in the context of this project course, I feel that my expertise may not be enough in either breadth or depth, due to the fact that I have not yet taken many upper year CS courses. This makes it even more important that I collaborate closely with my teammates so that we take full advantage of our respective strengths. Going into the project, I will keep all of this in mind.

**Q12: What key strengths and qualifications do you bring to a project team?**

I am a keen and adept learner and have a strong sense of responsibility, reflected in my success in taking on an internship role as a firmware engineer at AMD and finishing the year strongly with "exceeded expectations" reviews from my manager, even though the role required skills quite different from my original skillset. 

My key technical qualification are: 1) solid knowledge and experience with both system programming languages (C, C++, Rust) and popular higher-level languages (Python, TypeScript); 2) familiarity with popular front-end development toolkits such as React and Next.js; 3) good understanding of VCS and best practices in a collaborative software development environment; and 4) expertise in linguistics.

**Q13: What key strengths and qualifications would you like your colleagues to bring to your project team, and why?**

I would like all my team members to be motivated and determined to deliver a product that is impactful and benefits the greater good. I would like them to be good communicators and also not shy away from confronting and debating each other's ideas.

Since the topic of this year's course has not been announced, it is hard to say the exact technical skills I hope my teammates to have. However, it is best if at least one member of my team has expertise in one or more areas of artificial intelligence, as AI is a key area of advancement in the tech industry and has great potential in powering many life-changing discoveries and inventions. Furthermore, my ideal team would also consist of someone who has knowledge in an area that has great synergy with computer science. Of particular interest to me is knowledge in hardware design, as I am more interested in delivering a physical product than a pure software solution.

**Q14: Why do you want to take this course? What are your expectations and desired takeaways?**

I want to take this course because my career goal has never been to end up working in a "big tech company" and earn good money. Rather, I would like to use my computer science skills to build something that will actually, tangibly contribute to solving some of the world's problems. While this is easier said than done, I believe that building a startup is one of the best ways to achieve this goal. I also believe that, to achieve my goal, there are many disciplines that will benefit greatly if more people enter them bringing their computer science background. The DCSIL courses will prepare me for both things: given my limited experience with projects of this nature, it will help me tremendously in creating a startup by giving me the necessary business knowledge and technical experience; it will also provide me with the opportunity to network with like-minded people with expertise in other subjects.
