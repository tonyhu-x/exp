When people hear I study both linguistics and computer science, I always get one of
two kinds of responses. Either they assume I study computational linguistics
(the kind where computer sciencists study how to make machines understand and
speak human language); or they are in awe that I am studying two "such different" fields.
To the first response, while I do find natural language processing (synonymous with CL
in this sense) cool and full of potentials, there are other sub-fields in both linguistics
and computer science that I feel much more passion for.
As for the second response, both disciplines have instilled in me
an appreciation for the mathematical and scientific way of thinking and problem-solving,
which has been invaluable in my undergraduate years so far.
Furthermore, I believe firmly that my combined knowledge and experience in linguistics
and computer science elevate my competitive edge as a candidate for the Masters program
in linguistics at the University of Toronto. #highlight[This is probably too long.]

When people hear I study both linguistics and computer science, they either assume
I am interested in natural language processing, e.g. AI language models, machine
translation; or they are in awe that I am studying two "such different" fields.
While I am not interested in building ChatGPTs, I see much more intersection between
computer science and linguistics.

With the revised study design, we had intended to complete the main data collection
stage during the fall of 2024.
Unfortunately, due to our study design having restrictive requirements on
participant eligibility, recruitment has proven challenging.
We intend to continue recruiting participants over the winter.
In the mean time, it is clear that more time and effort beyond the winter semester
is warranted to continue improving the project, including extending the original
design to encompass learners with more diverse backgrounds, and conducting
follow-up studies to address new questions that may arise once we examine the
results.
The possibility of continuing and extending my current research work is one of the
biggest reasons why I am attracted to the linguistics graduate program at U of T.

Through my independent project, I realized how crucial it is to explore novel methods and tools
to study the complexities of language.
As I intend to devote myself to studying the theories and applications of SLA,
I believe there is a tremendous amount of potential in bringing knowledge and
tools from other disciplines, especially computer science.
Today, I already see many great examples of this.
For example, Professor Ewan Dunbar's lab uses computational methods to model human
speech perception.
Moreover, many researchers are attempting to crack the code of
first language acquisition using different computational techniques.
Compared to the active research in these areas, however, computational research in
SLA has only begun recently, and much work is needed to get the discipline up to
speed with these promising research directions.
From a different perspective, computational methods can also be used to implement
novel methods of teaching and learning second languages.
Experimenting with these new ideas, such as gamification using computers, and seeing
how they interact with variables like language aptitude will undoubtedly shed light on
SLA and even theoretical linguistics as a whole.
