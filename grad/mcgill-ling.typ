As a student, I am never satisfied with just knowing lecture materials.
I knew early on that the best way to keep up with cutting-edge research is to
be part of it.
As a result, besides completing the coursework for an undergraduate degree in linguistics
and computer science at the University of Toronto, I have also undertaken many
research opportunities at the same time.

My first research position was working with Professor Suzi Lima to investigate
various syntactic and semantic properties of two African languages spoken in
Toronto, Tshiluba and Kirundi.
In the span of eight months, I solidified my understanding of the principles of syntactic
and semantic analysis, and I gained first-hand experience conducting linguistic field
work through planning and leading elicitation sessions with language consultants.

In September 2022, I joined the Toronto Language and Cognition (TLC) Lab headed by
Professor Myrto Grigoroglou.
Since then, I have been working closely with Christiana Moser, a PhD student in the lab,
on the design and data processing of her cross-linguistic study on event conceptualization
and description.
I also participate actively in lab meetings, where members listen and
provide feedback on each other's ongoing research projects, and take part in other
lab activities such as participant recruitment events.

Both of these research experiences have afforded me the ability to efficiently read
and digest academic literature, and to adopt a critical mindset for designing and examining
research methodology.
In addition, I gained strong familiarity with the linguistics research process and 
practical experience with presenting research projects by attending poster
fairs and conferences as a student researcher.
In the fall of 2023, I decided to use the skills and experiences I accumulated
to kick-start my own research project in the area of linguistics that excites me
most --- second language acquisition.

While I am keen to solve many of linguistics's unsolved problems, the one question
that motivates me most is _Why do the outcomes of language acquisition differ so
significantly between adults and young children?_
In other words, I am interested especially in problems concerning
individual differences in _ultimate attainment_.
The reason that I developed such a strong interest is surprisingly simple --- having
successfully acquired English as a second language, I have always wondered what made
my experience different from many others, who may have just as much aspiration to learn
a language well but still seem unable to go beyond a certain glass ceiling.

Understanding ultimate attainment may be my "ultimate" goal, but it is no easy feat to
propose a grand theory in this subject.
To gather clues about all the factors at play, one can examine what happens during
the learning process itself.
My independent research project, supervised by Professor Jeffrey Steele,
is about exactly that.
In this project, we are investigating individual differences in _language aptitude_
and _working memory_, and how these cognitive constructs predict gains in
pronunciation proficiency for beginners learning French in a classroom setting.
With the help of Professor Steele, I designed a longitudinal study consisting of
seven tasks, after carefully examining and synthesizing current literature on language
aptitude, working memory, and related research methods.
I then completed two rounds of piloting before starting main data collection in
the September of 2024.
Furthermore, I reported preliminary findings from the first round of piloting in a 22-page
research paper.

Throughout the design and piloting phase, we continually refined our methodology,
specifically with respect to operationalizing pronunciation proficiency.
Acknowledging that no single measurement can paint a comprehensive picture
of participants' pronunciation abilities, we currently include four features as dependent variables
in our analysis: plosive VOT, phrasal stress, fluency, and perceived global accent.
The choice of fluency and perceived global accent was made to align with previous
studies on aptitude and pronunciation proficiency.
As for VOT and phrasal stress, we chose them by virtue of their being
well-studied phenomena representing segmental phonology and prosody, respectively.

Though the concept of language aptitude has been studied for a few decades, it is
still highly debated what cognitive abilities it ought to encompass.
Much of the literature to date only considers those abilities which are presumably
"specific" to language learning and are therefore testable using tasks which
resemble the language learning process.
However, I believe that a model which encompasses both traditional components of
language aptitude (language analytic ability, phonetic coding ability, etc.) and
domain-general cognitive abilities will be much more successful at predicting
L2 proficiency outcomes, especially as we test the notion of aptitude on previously
in new linguistic domains such as prosody.

My project is to my knowledge the first of its kind to study the links between
language aptitude and the acquisition of specific phonetic and phonological
phenomena.
As such, it is highly exploratory in nature.
Fortunately, the linguistics graduate program at McGill provides the perfect opportunity
for me to continue and extend this line of research.
Not only does the department offer highly relevant coursework in advanced phonetics,
phonology, and experimental design, I will also benefit greatly from being guided by
faculty members like Professor Heather Goad and Professor Meghan Clayards.
Their joint research on individual differences in the use of phonetic cues to
perceive non-native vowel contrasts is one example where I see a potential to test the
and refine the language aptitude framework.
Specifically, if differences in certain auditory abilities predict that some
learners are better at picking up native-like cue-weighting patterns, then any successful
model of language aptitude should account for such effects.
From a more general perspective, I would like to test whether any existing documented
effects of language aptitude on pronunciation, including any results to arise from my
current project, are in fact modulated through perception.
For this line of inquiry, Professor Clayards' expertise in perception research will
again be of great help.

My merits as a scholar are not only shown by my outstanding grades, the numerous
scholarships and awards I have received, and the research I have completed.
They are also corroborated by some non-monetary honours, such as my final
project for my intro to linguistics class being voted the best in class,
and being chosen as the first-year calculus class speaker for incoming math students.
I am convinced that my knowledge, skills, and character make me an exceptional candidate,
and that the graduate program in linguistics at McGill will provide me with a solid
foundation to pursue my future goals as a linguistics researcher.
