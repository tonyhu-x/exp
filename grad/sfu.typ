As a student, I am never satisfied with just knowing lecture materials.
I knew early on that the best way to keep up with cutting-edge research is to
be part of it.
As a result, besides completing the coursework for an undergraduate degree in linguistics
and computer science at the University of Toronto, I have also taken part in many
research opportunities at the same time.

My first research position was working with Professor Suzi Lima to investigate
various syntactic and semantic properties of two African languages spoken in
Toronto, Tshiluba and Kirundi.
In the span of eight months, I solidified my understanding of the principles of syntactic
and semantic analysis, and I gained first-hand experience conducting linguistic field
work through planning and leading elicitation sessions with language consultants.

In September 2022, I joined the Toronto Language and Cognition (TLC) Lab headed by
Professor Myrto Grigoroglou.
Since then, I have been working closely with Christiana Moser, a PhD student in the lab,
on the design and data processing of her cross-linguistic study on event conceptualization
and description.
I also participate actively in lab meetings, where members listen and
provide feedback on each other's ongoing research projects, and take part in other
lab activities such as participant recruitment events.

Both of these research experiences have enabled me to develop the ability to read
and digest academic literature, and to adopt a critical mindset for designing and examining
research methodology.
In addition, I have gained a strong familiarity with the linguistics research process and
practical experience with presenting research projects by attending poster
fairs and conferences as a student researcher.
In the fall of 2023, I decided to use the skills and experiences I accumulated
to kick-start my own research project in the area of linguistics that excites me
most --- second language acquisition.

While I am keen to solve many of linguistics's unsolved problems, the one question
that motivates me most is _Why do the outcomes of language acquisition differ so
significantly between adults and young children?_
In other words, I am interested especially in problems concerning
individual differences in _ultimate attainment_ of linguistic competence.
The reason that I developed such a strong interest is surprisingly simple --- having
successfully acquired English as a second language, I have always wondered what made
my experience different from many others, who may have just as much aspiration to learn
a language well but still seem unable to go beyond a certain glass ceiling.

Understanding ultimate attainment may be my "ultimate" goal, but it is no easy feat to
propose a grand theory in this subject.
To gather clues about all the factors at play, one can examine what happens during
the learning process itself.
My independent research project, supervised by Professor Jeffrey Steele,
is about exactly that.
In this project, we are investigating individual differences in _language aptitude_
and _working memory_, and how these cognitive constructs predict gains in
phonetic production abilities for beginners learning French in a classroom setting.
With the help of Professor Steele, I designed a longitudinal study consisting of
seven tasks, after carefully examining and synthesizing current literature on language
aptitude, working memory, and related research methods as well as tasks for
eliciting both segmental and prosodic phenomena.
I then completed two rounds of piloting before starting the main data collection in
the September of 2024.
Furthermore, I reported preliminary findings from the first round of piloting in a 22-page
research paper.

Throughout the design and piloting phase, we continually refined our methodology,
specifically with respect to operationalizing pronunciation proficiency.
Acknowledging that no single measurement can paint a comprehensive picture
of participants' pronunciation abilities, we are currently including four features as
dependent variables in our analysis: plosive VOT, phrasal stress, fluency, and perceived
global accent.
The choice of fluency and perceived global accent was made to align with previous
studies on aptitude and pronunciation proficiency.
As for VOT and phrasal stress, we chose them by virtue of their being
well-studied phenomena representing segmental and prosodic phonology, respectively.

There is no doubt that a thorough understanding of the impact of language learners'
individual differences will not only be a theoretical advancement, but it will also benefit
other disciplines such as language teaching.
Unfortunately, individual difference research often only examines surface language
phenomena such as fluency and vocabulary richness, with few probing into learners'
deeper syntactic or phonological knowledge.
On the other hand, researchers interested in the latter often treat all L2 speakers
as a homogenous group, at best separated roughly by level.
These speakers are then compared on a group level to L1 or other L2 speakers (e.g.
of a different language background), with little attention paid to intra-group variability
and what could contribute to such variability.

My project is to my knowledge the first of its kind to study the links between
language aptitude and the acquisition of specific phonetic and phonological phenomena.
As such, it is highly exploratory in nature.
Fortunately, the linguistics graduate program at SFU provides the perfect opportunity
for me to continue and extend this line of research.
Professor Henny Yeung, Professor Yue Wang, and their respective labs have done extensive
research on the perception and production of Mandarin tones.
With their guidance, I would like to investigate what individual difference variables predict L2
learners' success at picking up native-like cue-weighting patterns in a tonal context.
I would also like to extend their research on perception-production links through a focus
on L2 speakers.
This line of research will help answer whether any existing documented effects of language
aptitude on pronunciation, including any results to arise from my current project, are in
fact modulated through perception.

My merits as a scholar are not only shown by my outstanding grades, the numerous
scholarships and awards I have received, and the research I have completed.
They are also corroborated by some non-monetary honours, such as my final
project for my LIN101 class being voted the best in class,
and being chosen as the first-year calculus class speaker for incoming math students.
I am convinced that my knowledge, skills, and character make me an exceptional candidate,
and that the graduate program in linguistics at SFU will provide me with a solid
foundation to pursue my future career as a linguistics researcher.
