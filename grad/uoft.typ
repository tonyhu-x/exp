My curiosity about language was ignited when I took my first French class, after
moving to Canada for high school.
Since then, studying linguistics has been like a treasure hunt, making me
discover bits and pieces of hidden knowledge about languages I thought I knew
so well and languages I had no idea existed.
Now, after dedicating four and a half years of my undergrad to
studying linguistics along with my other passion, computer science, I have made
the decision to pursue a graduate degree in linguistics and contribute my own
share to the field.

As a student, I am never satisfied with just knowing lecture materials.
I knew early on that the best way to keep up with cutting-edge research is to
be part of it.
As a result, besides completing a Specialist program in linguistics,
I have also undertaken many research opportunities in my undergraduate years.
My first research position was working with Professor Suzi Lima to investigate
various syntactic and semantic properties of two African languages spoken in
Toronto, Tshiluba and Kirundi.
In the span of eight months, I solidified my understanding of the principles of syntactic
and semantic analysis, and I gained first-hand experience conducting linguistic field
work through planning and leading elicitation sessions with language consultants.

In September 2022, I joined the Toronto Language and Cognition (TLC) Lab headed by
Professor Myrto Grigoroglou.
Since then, I have been working closely with Christiana Moser, a PhD student in the lab,
on the design and data processing of her cross-linguistic study on event conceptualization
and description.
I also participate actively in lab meetings, where members listen and
provide feedback on others' ongoing research projects, and take part in other
lab activities such as participant recruitment events.

Both of these research experiences granted me the ability to efficiently read
and digest academic literature, the critical mindset to design and examine
research methodology, as well as high familiarity with the linguistic research process.
In addition, I gained practical experience with presenting research projects by attending
poster fairs and conferences as a student researcher.
In the fall of 2023, I decided to use the skills and experiences I accumulated
to kick-start my own research project in the area of linguistics that excites me
most --- second language acquisition.

While I am keen to solve many of linguistics's unsolved problems, the one question
that motivates me most is _Why do the outcomes of language acquisition differ so
significantly between adults and young children?_
In other words, I am interested especially in the class of problems relatad to
_ultimate attainment_.
The reason that I developed such a strong interest is surprisingly simple --- having
successfully acquired English as a second language, I have always wondered what made
my experience different from many others, who may have just as much aspiration to learn
a language well but still seem unable to get past a certain glass ceiling.

It is no easy feat to propose a grand theory of ultimate attainment.
To gather clues about all the factors at play, one can examine what happens during
the learning process itself.
My independent research project, supervised by Professor Jeffrey Steele,
is about exactly that.
In this project, we examine a cognitive construct named _language aptitude_ and how
it can predict gains in pronunciation proficiency for beginners in a classroom setting.
With the help of Professor Steele, I designed a longitudinal study consisting of
seven tasks, after carefully examining and synthesizing current literature on language
aptitude and related research methods.
I then completed two rounds of piloting, first in the winter and then in the summer of 2024,
to test and improve the methodology.
Furthermore, I reported preliminary findings from the first round of piloting in a 22-page
research paper.

With the revised study design, we had intended to complete the main data collection
stage during the fall of 2024.
Unfortunately, due to our study design having restrictive requirements on
participant eligibility, recruitment has proven challenging.
We intend to continue recruiting participants over the winter.
In the mean time, it is clear that more time and effort beyond the winter semester
is warranted to continue improving the project, including extending the original
design to encompass learners with more diverse backgrounds, and conducting
follow-up studies to address new questions that may arise once we examine the
results.
The possibility of continuing and extending my current research work is one of the
biggest reasons why I am attracted to the linguistics graduate program at U of T.

Through my independent project, I realized how crucial it is to explore novel methods and tools
to study the complexities of language.
As I intend to devote myself to studying the theories and applications of SLA,
I believe there is a tremendous amount of potential in bringing knowledge and
tools from other disciplines, especially computer science.
Today, I already see many great examples of this.
For example, Professor Ewan Dunbar's lab uses computational methods to model human
speech perception.
Moreover, many researchers are attempting to crack the code of
first language acquisition using different computational techniques.
Compared to the active research in these areas, however, computational research in
SLA has only begun recently, and much work is needed to get the discipline up to
speed with these promising research directions.
From a different perspective, computational methods can also be used to implement
novel methods of teaching and learning second languages.
Experimenting with these new ideas, such as gamification using computers, and seeing
how they interact with variables like language aptitude will undoubtedly shed light on
SLA and even theoretical linguistics as a whole.

My merits as a scholar are not only shown by my outstanding grades, numerous
scholarships and awards I have received, and the research I have completed.
They are also corroborated by some non-monetary honours, such as my final
project for LIN101 being voted the best in class, and being chosen as the MAT137 speaker
for incoming math students.
I am convinced that my knowledge, skills, and character make me an exceptional candidate,
and that the graduate program in linguistics at U of T will provide me with a solid
foundation to pursue my future goals as a linguistics researcher.
I would be very happy to continue to work under the supervision of Professor Steele.
I hope as well that, being part of the department, I will be able to receive guidance
from people like Professor Ewan Dunbar and Professor Nathan Sanders, both of whose research is
highly relevant to achieving my academic objectives.
