My curiosity about language was ignited when I took my first French class, after
moving to Canada for high school.
Since then, studying linguistics has been like a treasure hunt, allowing me to
discover bits and pieces of hidden knowledge about languages I thought I knew
so well as well as languages I had no idea existed.
Now, after dedicating four and a half years of my undergrad to
studying linguistics along with my other passion, computer science, I have made
the decision to pursue a graduate degree in linguistics in order to make my own
contributions to the field.

As a student, I am never satisfied with just knowing lecture materials.
I knew early on that the best way to keep up with cutting-edge research is to
be part of it.
As a result, besides completing a Specialist program in linguistics,
I have also taken part in many research opportunities in my undergraduate years.
My first research position was working with Professor Suzi Lima to investigate
various syntactic and semantic properties of two African languages spoken in
Toronto, Tshiluba and Kirundi.
In the span of eight months, I solidified my understanding of the principles of syntactic
and semantic analysis, and I gained first-hand experience conducting linguistic field
work through planning and leading elicitation sessions with language consultants.

In September 2022, I joined the Toronto Language and Cognition (TLC) Lab headed by
Professor Myrto Grigoroglou.
Since then, I have been working closely with Christiana Moser, a PhD student in the lab,
on the design and data processing of her cross-linguistic study on event conceptualization
and description.
I also participate actively in lab meetings, where members listen and
provide feedback on each other's ongoing research projects, and take part in other
lab activities such as participant recruitment events.

Both of these research experiences have enabled me to develop the ability to read
and digest academic literature, and to adopt a critical mindset for designing and examining
research methodology.
In addition, I have gained a strong familiarity with the linguistics research process and 
practical experience with presenting research projects by attending poster
fairs and conferences as a student researcher.
In the fall of 2023, I decided to use the skills and experiences I accumulated
to kick-start my own research project in the area of linguistics that excites me
most --- second language acquisition.

While I am keen to solve many of linguistics's unsolved problems, the one question
that motivates me most is _Why do the outcomes of language acquisition differ so
significantly between adults and young children?_
In other words, I am interested especially in problems concerning
individual differences in _ultimate attainment_ of linguistic competence.
The reason that I developed such a strong interest is surprisingly simple --- having
successfully acquired English as a second language, I have always wondered what made
my experience different from many others, who may have just as much aspiration to learn
a language well but still seem unable to go beyond a certain glass ceiling.

Understanding ultimate attainment may be my "ultimate" goal, but it is no easy feat to
propose a grand theory in this subject.
To gather clues about all the factors at play, one can examine what happens during
the learning process itself.
My independent research project, supervised by Professor Jeffrey Steele,
is about exactly that.
In this project, we are investigating individual differences in _language aptitude_
and _working memory_, and how these cognitive constructs predict gains in
phonetic production abilities for beginners learning French in a classroom setting.
With the help of Professor Steele, I designed a longitudinal study consisting of
seven tasks, after carefully examining and synthesizing current literature on language
aptitude, working memory, and related research methods as well as tasks for
eliciting both segmental and prosodic phenomena.
I then completed two rounds of piloting before starting the main data collection in
the September of 2024.
Furthermore, I reported preliminary findings from the first round of piloting in a 22-page
research paper.

Throughout the design and piloting phase, we continually refined our methodology,
specifically with respect to operationalizing pronunciation proficiency.
Acknowledging that no single measurement can paint a comprehensive picture
of participants' pronunciation abilities, we are currently including four features as
dependent variables in our analysis: plosive VOT, phrasal stress, fluency, and perceived
global accent.
The choice of fluency and perceived global accent was made to align with previous
studies on aptitude and pronunciation proficiency.
As for VOT and phrasal stress, we chose them by virtue of their being
well-studied phenomena representing segmental and prosodic phonology, respectively.

My project is to my knowledge the first of its kind to study the links between
language aptitude and the acquisition of specific phonetic and phonological
phenomena.
As such, it is highly exploratory in nature.
Fortunately, the linguistics graduate program at U of T provides the perfect opportunity
for me to continue and extend this line of research.
Not only does the department offer highly relevant coursework in advanced
phonetics (LIN1112, 1211), phonology (LIN1221, 1222), and experimental
design (LIN1106), some faculty members' research is also very relevant to mine.
To test language aptitude's predictive power in learners' sensitivity to minute phonetic
details, I would like to incorporate more fine-grained phonetic measurements in testing,
for example, learners' realization of the rhotic consonant / Å/ and nasal vowels,
both of which are usually considered challenging aspects of French phonology.
Professor Alexei Kochetov's experience with phonetics, phonology, and the interaction between
the two, coupled with Professor Steele's extensive knowledge in French and L2 acquisition,
will be of great help in this respect.
I am also interested in Professor Jessamyn Schertz's work on linking speech perception and
production.
With her guidance, I would like to explore whether the effects of individual differences
on L2 pronunciation are in fact modulated through their effects on perception; in other words,
is it the case that learners with higher language aptitude and working memory
perceive the differences better between their L1 phonology and the target L2's?

My merits as a scholar are not only shown by my outstanding grades, the numerous
scholarships and awards I have received, and the research I have completed.
They are also corroborated by some non-monetary honours, such as my final
project for LIN101 being voted the best in class, and being chosen as the MAT137 speaker
for incoming math students.
I am convinced that my knowledge, skills, and character make me an exceptional candidate,
and that the graduate program in linguistics at U of T will provide me with a solid
foundation to pursue my future goals as a linguistics researcher.
