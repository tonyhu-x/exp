When people hear I study both linguistics and computer science, I always get one of
two kinds of responses. Either they assume I study computational linguistics
(the kind where computer sciencists study how to make machines understand and
speak human language); or they are in awe that I am studying two "such different" fields.
To the first response, while I do find natural language processing (synonymous with CL
in this sense) cool and full of potentials, there are other sub-fields in both linguistics
and computer science that I feel much more passion for.
As for the second response, both disciplines have instilled in me
an appreciation for the mathematical and scientific way of thinking and problem-solving,
which has been invaluable in my undergraduate years so far.
Furthermore, I believe firmly that my combined knowledge and experience in linguistics
and computer science elevate my competitive edge as a candidate for the Masters program
in linguistics at the University of Toronto. #highlight[This is probably too long.]

I have always been curious about the structure of languages, their evolution,
and their representation in our minds. #highlight[Not always]

Besides completing a Specialist program in linguistics, I have also undertaken many
research opportunities in my undergraduate years.
In my first research position, I worked with Professor Suzi Lima to investigate
various syntactic and semantic proporties of two African languages spoken in
Toronto, Tshiluba and Kirundi.
In the span of eight months, I solidified my understanding of the principles of syntactic
and semantic analysis, and I gained first-hand experience conducting linguistic field
work through planning and leading elicitation sessions with language consultants.

In September 2022, I joined the Toronto Language and Cognition (TLC) Lab headed by
Professor Myrto Grigoroglou.
Since then, I have been working closely with Christiana Moser, a PhD student in the lab,
on the design and data processing of her cross-linguistic study on event conceptualization
and descriptions using psycholinguistic methods.
I also participate actively in lab meeting discussions, where members listen and
provide feedback on others' ongoing research projects, and other lab activities such
as participant recruitment events.

Both of these research experiences granted me the ability to efficiently read
and digest academic literature, the critical mindset to design and examine
research methodology, as well as high familiarity with the linguistic research process.
In addition, I gained practical experience with presenting research projects by attending
poster fairs and conferences as a student researcher.
In the second half of 2023, I decided to use the skills and experiences I accumulated
to kickstart my own research project in the area of linguistics that excites me
most --- second language acquisition.

While I am keen to solve many of linguistics's unsolved problems, the one question
that motivates me most is _Why do the outcomes of language acquisition differ so
significantly between adults and young children?_
In other words, I am interested especially in the class of problems reletad to
_ultimate attainment_.
To approach these problems, we can extract valuable clues by examining what happens
during the learning process itself.
My independent research project, supervised by of Professor Jeffrey Steele
is about exactly that.
In this project, we examine a cognitive construct termed _language aptitude_ and how
it can predict gains in language proficiency for beginners in a classroom setting.
With the help of Professor Steele, I designed a longitudinal study consisting of
seven tasks, after carefully examining and synthesizing current literature on language
aptitude and related research methods.
I then completed two rounds of piloting, first in the winter and then in the summer of 2024,
to test and improve the methodology.
Furthermore, I reported preliminary findings from the first round of piloting in a 22-page
research paper.

With the revised study design, we had intended to complete the main data collection
stage during the fall of 2024.
Unfortunately, due to our study design having restrictive
requirements on participant eligibility and an unexpectedly small size
of the participant pool, so far we have tested only five participants.
While we intend to continue participant recruitment over the winter, more time and
effort are required beyond that to realize the full potential of my original
conception of the study, and to conduct follow-up studies that address new
questions that may arise once we examine the results.
The possibility of continuing and extending my current research work is one of the
biggest reasons why I am interestd in pursuing graduate studies in linguistics at
the University of Toronto.
